# First Come First Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) task scheduling algorithms implemented in C++

The aim of this project is to implement scheduling algorithms. The user may specify multiple scheduling tasks in the input file. 
The program will write the output for these scheduling tasks to stdout, one after the other.

**This project was created during my Erasmus Scholarship at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.**
